# US-Fatalities-and-mileage-analysis
This project focuses on visualizing and analyzing trends in traffic fatalities and vehicle mileage across U.S. states from 2007 to 2018, using data sourced from Pennsylvaniaâ€™s public driving safety portal. The dashboard is designed to provide insights into road safety performance and identify improvement areas at both a national and state level.

Key Features:
ðŸ”¹ Interactive Summary Page:

KPIs dynamically display values based on state selection:

Total Fatalities (2007â€“2018)

Miles Travelled (in millions)

Deaths per 100 Million Miles Travelled (2018)

A gauge chart visualizes 2018â€™s death rate per 100 million miles with:

Min: 0

Max: 2.5

Target value: 1.2

Conditional indicator shows if the actual fatality rate is above or below the target.

ðŸ”¹ Choropleth Map with Conditional Formatting:

U.S. map highlights state-wise 2018 fatality rates per 100M miles, using color scaling:

Min: 0

Middle: 1.2 (Target)

Max: 2.5

Enables drill-down into individual states for year-wise trends.

ðŸ”¹ Drillthrough Report Pages:

Selecting a state in the map reveals detailed yearly data from 2007 to 2018:

Yearly fatalities and mileage

Line and bar charts for trend analysis
